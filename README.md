## Is it dangerous?

Your password is stored in plain text in the browser's `localStorage`. It's probably safe unless your computer is already broken into.

## Development

Clone this repo:

- `git clone git@github.com:abrkn/mes.git`
- `cd mes`

MES uses Browserify to package javascript/css into one file, [index.js](index.js).

Run the browserify builder:

- `npm run build`
